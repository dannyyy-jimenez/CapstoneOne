# 3 Proposals for Capstone One
---------------

### First Proposal

Using Spotify data [https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks] I will analyze the metrics measured in most popular streamed songs vs the not so popular streamed songs. I will also be looking into the popularity between explicit songs vs not explicit. Considering the data that I find I will make a hypothesis test.


### Second Proposal

Using the CDC Data [https://www.kaggle.com/spittman1248/cdc-data-nutrition-physical-activity-obesity?select=Nutrition__Physical_Activity__and_Obesity_-_Behavioral_Risk_Factor_Surveillance_System.csv] I will analyze the differences between physical activity and obesity within the united states, as well as see if the mean united states obesity rate is higher than the world obesity rate.
